FINAL PROPOSAL

1.The problem
Although Philadelphia is not the most dangerous cities in the U.S, the gun violence is
still threatening residents. From 2015 to 2018, over 1200 victims were reported annually.
There might be  some relationship of gun violence to demographic or spatial patterns.
I'm planning to establish a map showing these patterns of Philadelphia, gunshot data, and
the rate of gunshot crime.

2.The data
The data are from these websites:
OpenDataPhilly Parks & Recreation Assets: https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/parks-and-recreation-assets
OpenDataPhilly Shooting Victims: https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/shooting-victims
PASDA Philadelphia Aerial Photography 2018: http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=2019
PASDA Philadelphia Park Boundaries: http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/ DataSummary.aspx?dataset=1582
Philadelphia Buildings 2017: https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=146
Philadelphia Census Block Groups 2010: https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/census-block-groups
Property Assessments https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/opa-property-assessments
I'll try to find out if they are more appropriate to be used in json or geojson type.

3.Technologies used
leaflet, turf.js, jQuery, html/css......

4.Design spec
The users are supposed to be residents, tourists or department officials who concern about Philly's public safety.
The visual layout will be a map on the right and a sidebar on the left, with necessary informations.
