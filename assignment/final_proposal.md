# Final Project Proposal


## Problem / Question


I want to build a website where people can search around the data of high-growth
companies in Pennsylvania and their proximity to commercial airports, universities
and the patent volume of cities.

## The data


I will get the following datasets: high-growth companies, commercial airports,
airport passenger traffic, and top50 Pennsylvania Universities in US

## Technologies used


I'll use APIs of Patents View, tools in turf, leaflet draw, jQuery, and underscore
library. I'll gather graphic information from Patents View and geoJSON, and turf
and leaflet for line, polygon and circle drawing.

## Design spec

#### User experience



There'll be two groups of users in the website: entrepreneurs who want to build their own start-ups,
and researchers on high-growth business.
They will find interesting relationships between high-growth companies and the facilities.
Entrepreneurs will have inspiration on new company site selection, and researchers will expand
their understanding on geographic relationships of high-growth companies.
I'll compare my website to https://gophillygo.org/.

#### Layouts and visual design


I'll build top bar, sidebar, pop-up box and hover box for my website.

## Anticipated difficulties


The difficulty will lie in the global variable building and api application.

## Missing pieces


I want to learn more about constructing the interaction part of website.
